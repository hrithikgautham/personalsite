We all are concerned about what was and what will be?

And we are on a  hunting spree;

Abaft the money, power and fame;

In this journey we forget our aim;

in this journey we forget our aim

always in search of gain without any pain

we should be what He expected us to be

he will give us peace through  our storm

it is our duty to adorn 

It is our duty to adorn

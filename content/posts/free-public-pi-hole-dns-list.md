Here is the list of working Public Pi-hole DNS

Pi-hole is Network-Wide Ad Blocker that blocks ads of all sorts at the router level. It blocks advertisements on any device and improves overall network performance. For more information, watch this short video below.

For those of you who don’t own a Raspberry Pi, I’ve setup two internet facing Pi-hole servers. Both are running from a Virtual Private Server (VPS) in a datacenter, so no worries about latency or bandwidth issues. The exact details are as follows

Indian Education System in one of the worst in the world. Here Students are taught how to mug up rather than understanding the concepts. Once schooling is done, we are forced into engineering and medical streams which most of us are not interested in. In colleges, students try to pull each other down (Especially in my college). Here if someone is better than themselves, People try to take him down. They are also highly affected by peer pressure. Students spend most of their time in unhealthy competitions and end up mugging up and writing the exams rather than learning the subjects and applying them to solve real-life problems. The lecturers are no better as they do not encourage in practical learning. Students here tend to take advantage of people around only for their own selfish needs and tend to forget that there are other honest ways in life to be successful. This attitude prevents the overall positive growth of the country. After death, the only thing that remains is your legacy that you leave behind. We must make it legendary. It wonâ€™t matter if you have a lot of wealth the only thing that matters is your character. For everything else, Karma is there to take care of it.

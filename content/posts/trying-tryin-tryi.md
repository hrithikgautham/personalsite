If Man can walk on moon ,

Then everything is possible,

If Gandhi forced British to go without any weapon,

Then everything is possible,

If Man can go to deepest point in the ocean,

Then everything is possible,

If you can then you will....

Without any hesitation and with your skill,

All you have to do is believe,

And Try hard until you achieve,

There is long way for you to go,

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

🖖🏻😜😃

Be Postive

**Peace out**

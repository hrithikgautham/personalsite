When things don't go right,  
When everything in life is not so bright .. Just breathe.  
When u feel you are rejected, If nothing goes as expected... Just breathe. When you are feeling blue, If u think there is no one for you... Just breathe.  
When people break your heart, Even if you have done your part.. Just breathe.  
Because, if u are still breathing it means u have another chance,  
Under the sunshine, you can once more dance. Just breathe

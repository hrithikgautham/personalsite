<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we&rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the &ldquo;$&rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with &ldquo;#&rdquo; are comments that I&rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the &ldquo;:wq&rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>According to World Health Organisation (WHO) study, 90% of the info to the human brain is sent through eyes alone. The Study also says that there are about 285 million visually impaired or blind people across world. In this paper, we proposed an efficient, reliable and low-cost wearable jacket for the people suffering from visual impaired. A smart jacket is designed by embedding the sensor on the jacket, that enables the user to detect an obstacle and safely navigate. The prototype model has an accuracy of 98% for obstacle with in 200cm. The smart jacket requires low power hence can be used for real time navigation for visually impaired people.</p>

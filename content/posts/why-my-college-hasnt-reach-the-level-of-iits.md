Note- This post is not intended towards anyone or I want to point out anyone in this matter. These are just thoughts I may or may not be correct.  From past few days, I have been noticing few things that people do in my College. A Special character that most of them have it and that is a bad level of **selfishness. ** Sometimes I wonder how can a person reach a level so low that he sees only his interests and cares only about the things that will profit him/her. This is a really bad thing. Gone are the days when people used to work individually and care only about there vested interests. In the Modern world to be successful we need more collaboration among people, especially among students. ![](http://blog.bsiddhartha.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_1206-300x292.jpg) Now what I have noticed few of the students poke their freaking nose in everything not allowing others to participate or share any information about the opportunities that are available. We can't even blame such people may be because of lack of interest shown by others. Each one of us needs to actively participate in the events/ happenings that take place in college. But again the  information that is confined to only a few people. And These few are like foxes they are so cunning that they don't allow anyone else apart from their group to participate or help even though the person who wants to help has no ulterior motives unlike them. Yes, These **Foxes** may have a lot of things to add it to their CV but Knowledge is more important than anything else. People need to have to helping nature. Help without any Expectation or ulterior motives and I assure you the happiness you will feel cannot be explained in words. The other breed of foxes can be spotted in the class, This breed of foxes are evil than the other. These usually attend classes just to disturb the other students. This happened very recently where the Professor who was really interested to teach and there were few students who were really interested to listen but these foxes were so busy in making noise and talking to each other, Disturbing other may be purposely or not  I am not sure. ![](http://blog.bsiddhartha.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vulpes_vulpes_laying_in_snow.jpg) What I want to say is, We all need to stop the silly politics. It will only help you to climb the ladder up to a stage. A stage where you will only find other foxes like you. If you really want to be successful try being less a politician and more a student One who helps everyone no matter whether they are in their group or not. Try once will enjoy it. I want to see my college to reach the level of IITs and for this to happen we all need to work together not against each other. We have the best in class Faculty and Infrastructure, The attitude of the students is what Stopping us :)

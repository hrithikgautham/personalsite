Hi there, I'm **B Siddhartha**. I love computers and really enjoy writing code. Currently I am an undergraduate student at RVCE studying Electronics and Communication with a concentration in automation, IIOT and interested in distributed systems, how they work, their reliability and scalability. I enjoy solving complex technical problems.

Apart from computers 💻, I really enjoy reading📚, traveling🛸, walking🚶🏻‍♂️, Jazz music🎵 and Football⚽.

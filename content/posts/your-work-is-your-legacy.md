Today Khandekar Mam(HOD Dept of Architecture) had called me, When I met Mam. I was surprised, She gave me this chocolate and said thank you for all the work I have done for the college from past three years. I was speechless for a minute I didn't know what to say.  
When my own department was busy in "EGO" Wars. I don't want to name the department but I can only say that we study Electronics. I am Invisible to people in the department unless they have any work.  
This chocolate is worth more then any other AWARD.. Because it reminds me There are still good people alive in this world and Hard work never goes in vain.  
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU MAM AND THANK YOU TO ALL MY FRIENDS FROM MECH, CIVIL, Arch, CS.

"Carve your name on hearts, not AWARDS. A legacy is etched into the minds of others and the stories they share about you"

      <description>I am 🤦‍♂️fed up of frequently checking my college website for results. So I have published this app. It will automatically check any website and notify whenever any change is detected ✅ Use case - Exam Result Website ☺ The App has following features ⭐ -A detail view, that allows the user to compare the current website version with previous versions. -A settings view, that allows the user to toggle auto-sync on/off and configure what is required for a sync to occur.</description>

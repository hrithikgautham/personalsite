Jio has revolutionised the way we use the Internet in India. Just a year ago Indians used to spend around Rs.250 per month / Per GB, now this sounds ridiculous. This is actually good, an Affordable internet is good for the nation as well as for its economy. So a few days ago I contacted JioÂ because I was charged against the quota for the usage between 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM. Today got the reply and Yes JIO does not provide Night Free Unlimited between 2 to 3 AM. Below is the screen shot of email convo. \[caption id="attachment_10970" align="alignnone" width="1634"\]![Jio Night Unlimited](https://bsid.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0863.jpg) Jio Night Unlimited\[/caption\]

There is no greater pain than that of regret.  

Nothing can kill your soul more than the feeling of regret.

Never be afraid to take a risk in life. Never be afraid to take a risk going after what YOU really want.

You may fail, you will most likely fail often.  But failure going after your dreams is NOTHING compared to the failure that is settling for a life you don’t want.

It’s never too late to try again!  
It’s never to late to DECIDE you want more out of life.  
It’s NEVER TOO LATE!

It’s never too late to commit to make this day, THIS VERY DAY, the BEST of your life!  
To create opportunities for yourself.  To be positive.  To RISE above average thoughts.

It’s NEVER TOO LATE to re invent yourself.  
To learn something new.  
To grow. To feel good again.

No matter what has happened or failed to happen in your past: IT IS NEVER TOO LATE.  But only if you are committed.  
Only if YOU want to change.  
Do you want to change?  
Do you want more out of life?

You wouldn’t be the first person on earth to turn everything around.  
It is NOT impossible.  
All it takes is your commitment, your COURAGE and your DESIRE to be better.

Most people don’t change because they lack courage.  Because they FEAR the unknown. They FEAR failure.  
YOU are different.  
YOU have the courage.  The courage to try.

Don’t fear failure. FEAR being in the exactly same place next year as you are today.

Nobody is going to make your dream a REALITY!  
That’s up to YOU.  
That’s why you can’t GIVE UP.  
This is YOUR dream!  
And you are capable!  
You are more than capable!  
NEVER SETTLE.  NEVER SETTLE for less than you’re worth!  
If you are suffering . If you are fighting through pain, through adversity, WHATEVER YOU ARE GOING THROUGH:   DO NOT GIVE UP!  
It will get better!  
After the rain comes the rainbow.  After the storm the sun will shine.  Even on the cloudiest days. Your sun is still shining. Just wait for those clouds to pass.   Tomorrow is a new day, a better day.

It’s time!  
Today is the day!  
The first day of the rest of your life!

Make that commitment.  
Show me your courage!  
Be fearless!

NEVER GIVE UP. Can you hear me?  
I don’t care if you’re living in your car.  
I don’t care if you’re sleeping on the side of a gas station.  
NEVER GIVE UP!

You gotta KEEP FIGHTING.  
Because if you stop, nobody’s gonna pick you up.  
Those cars are going to continue to roll past you.  
But you KEEP WALKING!

It’s that destination that you have in your SOUL. It’s where you want to make it.  
See, your tears, will become the ocean, that leads to your paradise.

I don’t care if you’re a woman. I don’t care if you’re a man. I don’t care if you’re a child:  
The toughest battles come to the toughest warriors.

You gotta see it, like it’s already in your hand.  
You gotta walk, like you’re already a star. Even, if you have nothing in your pocket.

That PRIDE. That PURPOSE. That GIFT.  
Will give you the ability to walk into the room, full of millionaires, and they ALL will want to know you.

But you can NEVER GIVE UP  
You can never stop fighting for that TOP SPOT.

See, you’ve got to become rich on the inside, before you can become rich on the outside.  
YOU NEED THIS. So WHEN you get to the TOP, you know how it feels to be at the BOTTOM.  
You know how it feels to give another person a shot.

NEVER GIVE UP!

MAKE GOOD CHOICES TODAY so you have NO REGRETS tomorrow!  
BE BRAVE TODAY so you have NO REGRETS tomorrow!  
LIVE FULLY TODAY so you have NO REGRETS tomorrow  
NO MORE REGRETS!  NO TURNING BACK !  
I’M ALL IN!  
ALL IN FOR MY GOALS!  
ALL IN FOR MY DREAMS!

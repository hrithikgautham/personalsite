When your motive is to harm, you will be hurt. When your motive is to deceive, you will find yourself cheated. If your motive is to take, you'll end up being robbed. If your motive is to give, you will find that you receive. If your motive is to teach, the result is that you'll learn. When your motive is to appreciate, you will end up being admired. When your motive is to help, you yourself will be helped. If your motive is to nourish, you will find yourself growing.  
You cannot escape your own motives, even though they may be directed toward others. They come back to you as well. Whether that moves you forward or holds you back depends on the particular motives with which you choose to act. The sincerity and integrity of your motives will directly affect the quality of your life.
